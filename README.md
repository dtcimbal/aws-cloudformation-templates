# aws-cloudformation-templates
AWS CloudFormation templates addressed to different deployment cases

The cases are organized by AWS services so go `./aws/ec2` or `./aws/ecs` to see the templates.

You should be able to find a README for each case with the description of that particular case.

Feel free to use either `aws cli` or AWS Console (Web UI) to deploy templates.
